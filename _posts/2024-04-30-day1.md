## Run

1.81 miles 18:42 @10:20/mi

Thoughts?

Was first day, tough, new place, new race. No music just jamming to the piter pater.

Saucony Switchback 2 - Initial Thoughts... 

This was a mistake. Great shoe, love it. But not for running, at least not on the road or sidewalk, or anywhere that is not the trail. Even then, I have not tested, my trails in Florida are much different terrain than elsewhere. There is just not enough sole of the shoe. The Boas LOVE. LOVE. This is the all-around shoe, but not for running.
