## Run

2.03 miles 21:57 ~@11:00/mi

### Thoughts?

Well was thinking it was time to stop, then realized I'd have to walk home. Restarted and it was worth it. Not trying to get injuried, so I want to be respectfully of my body's capability. But FUCK, I'm impatient.

### Jams
Cameron Hanes KHC 066 - "We Must Endure"

Kevin Fallon and Dave Dombrow are just absolute legends in the making. Speedland and Boa are gonna be big. I love the lacing system, I picked up a pair of shoes with the boas just to make sure I liked them prior to dropping a dime on the new Speedland shoe.

### Shoes
Nike Pegasus 40 - Daily Trainer
