description: Building my documentation website using Jekyll, a static site generator.
---

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms markdown text into static web sites and blogs. Here I will be using it for a documentation site. Jekyll is fast, secure, easy, and open source. This is a guide to installing and configuring Jekyll, and the Chirpy theme. It will go over configuring the site, creating some pages using markdown, automatically using GitHub actions to build the site, and using GitHub pages to host the site.

It's possible in the future I will self-host the site. For future-proofing, I will include how to host locally, using a spare server or making a Docker container.

# Terminal Setup

Configure the terminal like mine!

### Windows

- [Windows Terminal and WSL Config Fast, Simple, and Easy Guide](https://technotim.live/posts/windows-terminal-wsl/)
- [Setting up Windows for JavaScript Development the right way (WSL Terminal NVM Node Yarn VS Code ZSH)](https://technotim.live/posts/windows-developer-setup/)
  - You can follow this guide up until installing NodeJS (We don't need NodeJS for Jekyll)

### MacOS

# Install Dependencies

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev git
```

To avoid installing RubyGems packages as the root user:
If you're using `zsh`

```shell
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Install Jekyll `bundler`

```shell
gem install jekyll bundler
```

# Create a site based on the Chirpy theme

Visit [https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#quick-start)

Sign in to GitHub and browse to Chirpy Starter, click the button <kbd>Use this template</kbd> > <kbd>Create a new repository<kbd>, and name the new repository `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` represents your GitHub username.

```shell
git clone git@<YOUR-USER-NAME>/<YOUR-REPO-NAME>.git
```

then install dependencies

```shell
cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
bundle
```

After manking changes to the site, commit and push then up to git

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "made some changes"
git push
```

# Jekyll Commands

Serving the site

```shell
bundle exec jekyll s
```

Building the site in production mode

```shell
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

This will output the porduction site to `_site`

# Building Site in CI

This site already works with GitHub actions, just push it up and check the actions Tab.,

For GitLab you can see the pipeline I built for my own docs site here

# Building with Docker

Create a `Dockerfile` with the following

```shell
FROM nginx:stable-alpine
COPY _site /usr/share/nginx/html
```

Build site in production mode

```shell
JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll b
```

Then build your image:

`docker build .`

# Creating a Post

## Naming Conventions

Jekyll uses a naming convention for pages and posts

Create a file in \_posts with the format

YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
For example:

2022-05-23-homelab-docs.md
2022-05-34-hardware-specs.md

> Jekyll can delay posts which have the date/time set for a point in the future determined by the “front matter” section at the top of your post file. Check the date & time as well as time zone if you don’t see a post appear shortly after re-build.
> {: .prompt-tip }

## Local Linking of Files

Image from asset:

```shell
... which is shown in the screenshot below:
![A screenshot](/assets/screenshot.webp)
```

Linking to a file

```shell
... you can [download the PDF](/assets/diagram.pdf) here.
```

See more post formatting rules on the Jekyll site

## Markdown Examples

If you need some help with markdown, check out the markdown cheat sheet.

I have lots of examples in my documentation site repo. Just click on the Raw button to see the code behind the page.

For more neat syntax for the Chirpy theme check their demo page on making posts https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/write-a-new-post/
